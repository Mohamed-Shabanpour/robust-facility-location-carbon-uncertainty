# Figure Analysis and Operational Interpretation

This document provides a detailed interpretation of the figures generated by the computational experiments. The analysis focuses on how demand uncertainty, transportation cost variability, carbon pricing, and facility disruption risk jointly shape facility location decisions, cost structures, and regret behaviour under different optimisation paradigms.

All interpretations are grounded in the observed numerical results and visual outputs.

## Figure 1: Robust Min–Max Regret Facility Location Map

The robust min–max regret solution opens two facilities, forming a compact and selectively conservative network. Customer–facility assignments reflect a deliberate balance between transportation efficiency and exposure to regret across scenarios.

Rather than maximising redundancy, the robust solution avoids facility openings that are highly scenario-dependent. In this instance, opening fewer facilities reduces the risk of incurring large regret relative to scenario-optimal benchmarks, particularly in scenarios where additional facilities become cost-inefficient due to fixed costs, carbon pricing, or disruption.

From an operations perspective, this illustrates a key property of min–max regret optimisation: robustness is achieved through stability relative to scenario optima, not necessarily through spatial diversification.

## Figure 2: Stochastic Expected-Cost Facility Location Map

The stochastic expected-cost solution opens three facilities, resulting in a more spatially distributed network than the robust solution. Facility selection and customer assignments prioritise minimisation of expected costs under the assumed scenario probabilities.

This configuration performs well on average and coincides with scenario-optimal solutions in some cases. However, the network structure remains sensitive to adverse scenarios that deviate from expected conditions, particularly those involving demand surges or facility disruptions.

Operationally, the stochastic solution reflects efficiency-driven planning with limited protection against low-probability, high-impact events.

## Figure 3: Cost Comparison Across Scenarios  
*(Scenario Optimal vs Robust vs Stochastic)*

This figure compares total costs across scenarios for scenario-optimal solutions, the robust min–max regret solution, and the stochastic expected-cost solution.

The stochastic solution closely tracks scenario-optimal costs in favourable scenarios but exhibits sharp cost increases in adverse ones. The robust solution displays a narrower dispersion of costs across scenarios, indicating controlled downside exposure.

The key operational insight is that robustness is achieved by smoothing cost variability across uncertain futures rather than by minimising cost in any single scenario.

## Figure 4: Regret per Scenario

The regret plot highlights structural differences between the optimisation paradigms. The stochastic expected-cost solution exhibits zero regret in some scenarios, indicating coincidence with scenario-optimal decisions. However, it incurs substantial regret in adverse scenarios.

In contrast, the robust solution consistently caps regret across all scenarios, reflecting its explicit objective of minimising worst-case deviation from scenario-optimal performance.

This asymmetry underscores the risk profile of expectation-based optimisation for strategic, irreversible decisions.

## Figure 5: Worst-Case Cost Breakdown  
*(Fixed, Transport, Carbon)*

The cost breakdown in the worst-case scenario shows that the robust solution incurs higher transportation and carbon costs than the stochastic solution. This outcome is intentional rather than inefficient.

The robust model accepts higher operational costs in the worst-case scenario to prevent extreme regret relative to scenario-optimal benchmarks. The stochastic solution achieves lower absolute costs in this scenario but remains exposed to significantly higher regret elsewhere.

This distinction highlights that robust optimisation manages performance risk rather than minimising absolute cost levels.

## Figure 6: Efficiency–Robustness Trade-off  
*(Expected Cost vs Worst-Case Regret)*

This figure depicts the trade-off between expected cost efficiency and worst-case performance risk. Each point represents a fully implementable facility location and assignment policy.

The stochastic solution achieves a slightly lower expected total cost (≈10,395) but incurs a substantially higher worst-case regret (≈860). The robust solution exhibits a marginally higher expected cost (≈10,418) while reducing worst-case regret to approximately 750.

Quantitatively, the robust solution sacrifices about 0.2% in expected cost in exchange for a reduction of nearly 13% in worst-case regret. This asymmetric trade-off illustrates the core value of min–max regret optimisation: small efficiency losses can yield disproportionately large gains in downside protection.

From an operations management perspective, this figure demonstrates why robust optimisation represents a balanced strategic choice when both efficiency and risk exposure are jointly considered.

## Summary of Operational Insights

- Min–max regret optimisation prioritises stability relative to scenario-optimal benchmarks rather than maximising redundancy.
- Stochastic optimisation can be highly efficient on average but exhibits asymmetric vulnerability to adverse scenarios.
- Carbon pricing materially affects assignment decisions and amplifies regret exposure.
- The efficiency–robustness trade-off confirms that robust optimisation offers a pragmatic balance for long-term strategic facility location under deep uncertainty.
