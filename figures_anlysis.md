# Figure Analysis and Operational Interpretation

This document provides an analytical interpretation of the figures generated by the computational experiments. The focus is on understanding how uncertainty, carbon pricing, and disruption risk influence facility location decisions, cost structures, and regret behaviour.

## Figure 1: Robust Min–Max Regret Facility Location Map

The robust facility map illustrates the set of facilities selected under the min–max regret criterion and the resulting customer–facility assignments. The solution typically exhibits a geographically dispersed pattern of opened facilities.

From an operations perspective, this diversification reflects a hedging strategy against multiple sources of uncertainty. By maintaining spatial coverage, the robust solution reduces exposure to localised demand surges, transportation cost spikes, and facility disruptions. Customer assignments are less concentrated, leading to more balanced flows across facilities.

This structure sacrifices some scale economies but significantly limits worst-case cost escalation.

## Figure 2: Stochastic Expected-Cost Facility Location Map

The stochastic facility map shows a more concentrated network structure, with fewer facilities opened and higher utilisation of selected locations. Customer assignments prioritise expected transportation and fixed cost efficiency.

While this configuration performs well under average conditions, it exhibits structural fragility. Demand surges, carbon price increases, or facility failures disproportionately affect a small number of critical nodes, amplifying regret in adverse scenarios.

This contrast highlights the operational risk embedded in expectation-based optimisation.

## Figure 3: Cost Comparison Across Scenarios (Robust vs Stochastic vs Optimal)

This figure compares total costs across scenarios for:
- Scenario-optimal solutions
- Robust min–max regret solution
- Stochastic expected-cost solution

The scenario-optimal costs serve as lower bounds. The stochastic solution tracks these bounds closely in favourable scenarios but deviates sharply under adverse conditions. The robust solution exhibits a narrower cost dispersion across scenarios, indicating controlled downside risk.

Operationally, this demonstrates that robustness is achieved not by minimising costs everywhere, but by limiting cost volatility across uncertain futures.

## Figure 4: Regret per Scenario

The regret plot highlights stark differences in vulnerability. The stochastic solution experiences high regret in scenarios characterised by demand spikes, high carbon prices, or facility disruptions. In contrast, the robust solution caps regret across all scenarios.

This behaviour is particularly relevant for strategic decisions with long lifetimes, where exposure to extreme outcomes can dominate performance evaluation.

## Figure 5: Worst-Case Cost Breakdown (Fixed, Transport, Carbon)

The cost breakdown pie charts decompose total costs in the worst-case scenario for both robust and stochastic solutions.

The robust solution displays a more balanced cost composition, with moderated transportation and carbon cost shares. The stochastic solution concentrates costs in transportation and carbon components, reflecting longer average distances and higher sensitivity to carbon pricing.

This figure illustrates how robust optimisation implicitly internalises environmental and operational risk, leading to structurally different networks even when explicit environmental objectives are absent.

## Summary of Operational Insights

- Robust optimisation promotes spatial diversification and flow balancing.
- Stochastic optimisation prioritises efficiency but amplifies downside risk.
- Carbon pricing significantly reshapes assignment decisions and worst-case exposure.
- Min–max regret optimisation provides a pragmatic framework for long-term strategic planning under deep uncertainty.
