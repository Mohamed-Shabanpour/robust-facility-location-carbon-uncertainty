# Figure Analysis and Operational Interpretation

This document provides a detailed interpretation of the figures generated by the computational experiments. The analysis focuses on how demand uncertainty, transportation cost variability, carbon pricing, and facility disruption risk jointly shape facility location decisions, cost structures, and regret behaviour under different optimisation paradigms.

All interpretations are based directly on the observed numerical results and visual outputs.

## Figure 1: Robust Min–Max Regret Facility Location Map

The robust min–max regret solution opens **two facilities**, forming a compact but strategically positioned network. Customer–facility assignments reflect a deliberate trade-off between transportation efficiency and exposure to regret across scenarios.

Importantly, the robust solution does **not** maximise redundancy. Instead, it limits regret by avoiding facility openings that are optimal in some scenarios but strongly suboptimal in others due to high fixed costs or disruption exposure. In this instance, opening fewer facilities reduces the risk of incurring large regret relative to scenario-optimal benchmarks.

From an operations perspective, this illustrates a key property of min–max regret optimisation: robustness is achieved through **stability relative to scenario optima**, not necessarily through spatial diversification or capacity proliferation.

## Figure 2: Stochastic Expected-Cost Facility Location Map

The stochastic expected-cost solution opens **three facilities**, resulting in a more spatially distributed network compared to the robust solution. Facility selection and customer assignments prioritise minimisation of expected costs under the assumed scenario probabilities.

This configuration performs well in average conditions and coincides with scenario-optimal solutions in some cases. However, the network structure is sensitive to deviations from expected conditions, particularly under demand surges, carbon price increases, or facility disruptions.

Operationally, the stochastic solution reflects a strategy that leverages probabilistic beliefs but remains vulnerable to scenarios that receive low probability weight yet have high cost impact.

## Figure 3: Cost Comparison Across Scenarios  
*(Scenario Optimal vs Robust vs Stochastic)*

This figure compares total costs across scenarios for:
- Scenario-optimal solutions (lower bounds)
- Robust min–max regret solution
- Stochastic expected-cost solution

The stochastic solution tracks the scenario-optimal costs closely in favourable scenarios but exhibits substantial cost increases in adverse scenarios. The robust solution shows a narrower dispersion of costs across scenarios, reflecting controlled downside exposure.

The key operational insight is that robustness is achieved by **smoothing cost variability across scenarios**, rather than minimising costs in any single scenario.

## Figure 4: Regret per Scenario

The regret plot highlights structural differences between the two paradigms.

The stochastic expected-cost solution exhibits **zero regret in some scenarios**, indicating that it coincides with the scenario-optimal solution under those conditions. However, it incurs **large regret in adverse scenarios**, particularly those involving demand surges, high carbon prices, or disruptions.

The robust solution consistently caps regret across all scenarios, even when this leads to higher absolute costs. This behaviour reflects the explicit objective of minimising worst-case deviation from scenario-optimal performance.

From a strategic planning perspective, this asymmetry illustrates why expectation-based optimisation can be risky for long-term decisions with irreversible investments.

## Figure 5: Worst-Case Cost Breakdown  
*(Fixed, Transport, Carbon)*

The cost breakdown in the worst-case scenario reveals that the **robust solution incurs higher transportation and carbon costs** than the stochastic solution. This outcome is intentional rather than incidental.

The robust model prioritises regret minimisation over absolute cost minimisation, accepting higher operational costs in the worst-case scenario to avoid extreme deviations from scenario-optimal benchmarks. In contrast, the stochastic solution achieves lower absolute costs in this scenario but remains exposed to significantly higher regret elsewhere.

This figure underscores a critical distinction in operations management:
robust optimisation manages **performance risk**, not just cost levels.

## Summary of Operational Insights

- Min–max regret optimisation does not inherently lead to opening more facilities; instead, it selects configurations that minimise instability relative to scenario-optimal solutions.
- Stochastic optimisation can achieve scenario-optimal performance in benign conditions but exhibits asymmetric vulnerability to adverse scenarios.
- Carbon pricing materially affects assignment decisions and amplifies regret exposure under expectation-based optimisation.
- Robust optimisation reallocates cost toward operational flexibility and regret control, even when this increases absolute costs in specific scenarios.

Overall, the figures demonstrate that min–max regret provides a pragmatic and analytically distinct approach to strategic facility location under deep uncertainty.
