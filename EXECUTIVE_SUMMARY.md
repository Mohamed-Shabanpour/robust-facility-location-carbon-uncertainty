## Executive Summary

This project examines how strategic facility location decisions should be designed when supply chains are exposed to simultaneous demand uncertainty, transportation cost variability, carbon pricing, and facility disruption risks. Such environments are increasingly common in practice, particularly under sustainability regulation and heightened operational volatility.

A scenario-based optimisation framework is developed and analysed using three complementary paradigms: deterministic optimisation, stochastic programming, and robust optimisation. Deterministic scenario-wise models establish cost-efficient benchmarks under perfect foresight. A stochastic expected-cost model incorporates probabilistic beliefs about future scenarios and prioritises average performance. A robust min–max regret model, in contrast, seeks decisions that limit the worst-case deviation from scenario-optimal outcomes.

Computational results demonstrate that robustness considerations materially alter strategic facility location decisions. Robust min–max regret solutions diversify facility openings, trading marginal increases in expected cost for substantial reductions in worst-case regret. Stochastic solutions, while efficient on average, tend to concentrate capacity and exhibit high vulnerability under adverse demand, cost, and disruption scenarios.

Carbon pricing emerges as a structurally important driver of network design. Higher carbon prices shift customer–facility assignments toward geographically closer pairings and, in some scenarios, alter facility opening decisions altogether. These effects are amplified under robust optimisation, where environmental costs contribute to worst-case exposure.

From an operations management perspective, the results highlight a fundamental efficiency–robustness trade-off in strategic network design. The min–max regret framework provides a practical middle ground between purely expected-cost optimisation and overly conservative worst-case approaches, making it particularly suitable for long-term supply chain planning under regulatory and operational uncertainty.
