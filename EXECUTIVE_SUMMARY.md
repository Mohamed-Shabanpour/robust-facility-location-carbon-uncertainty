## Executive Summary

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design a strategic supply chain network that remains cost-efficient and resilient under demand uncertainty, transportation volatility, carbon pricing, and facility disruption risks.

### Approach
A scenario-based optimisation framework is developed and analysed using three paradigms: deterministic optimisation, stochastic programming, and robust optimisation. Robust decisions are obtained using a min–max regret criterion, ensuring protection against worst-case deviations from scenario-optimal performance.

### Contributions
- Demonstrates how robustness considerations alter facility location decisions.
- Quantifies trade-offs between expected performance and worst-case protection.
- Illustrates the impact of carbon pricing on network structure and assignment decisions.
- Provides a reproducible modelling framework for sustainability-aware supply chain design.
