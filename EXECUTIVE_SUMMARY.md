## Executive Summary

This project examines how strategic facility location decisions should be designed when supply chains are exposed to demand uncertainty, transportation cost variability, carbon pricing, and facility disruption risks.

A scenario-based optimisation framework is developed using three paradigms: deterministic optimisation, stochastic programming, and robust optimisation. Deterministic models establish scenario-optimal cost benchmarks. A stochastic expected-cost model prioritises average performance based on scenario probabilities. A robust min–max regret model seeks decisions that limit the worst-case deviation from scenario-optimal outcomes.

Computational results demonstrate a clear efficiency–robustness trade-off. The robust solution incurs a negligible increase in expected cost while achieving a substantial reduction in worst-case regret relative to the stochastic solution. This trade-off highlights the value of regret-based optimisation for strategic decisions involving irreversible investments and exposure to adverse scenarios.

Carbon pricing plays a structurally important role by reshaping customer–facility assignments and amplifying regret exposure. Overall, the findings position min–max regret optimisation as a balanced and decision-relevant framework for long-term supply chain planning under deep uncertainty.
